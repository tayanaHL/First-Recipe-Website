    <h1>Quinoa with Roasted Butternut Squash</h1>
<h4><p> A delicious plant based protein-packed dish with some subtly sweet butternut squash and dried cranberries.
</p></h4>
<h4><p>Ingredients</p></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>One (2-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup shelled pistachios</li>
        <li>1½ cups quinoa</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth or water</li>
        <li>¼ cup dried cranberries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>3 ounces baby spinach</li>
    </ul>

<h4><p>Steps</p></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the squash in a medium bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the oil, the thyme and 2 teaspoons of salt and season with pepper to taste. Mix until the squash is well coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and spread squash out into a single layer. Roast until a paring knife slides into the squash with no resistance, about 30 minutes, stirring about halfway through the cooking time. Put the pistachios on a small baking sheet and toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the quinoa in cold water in a fine-mesh strainer. Bring the broth or water to a boil and stir in the quinoa. Simmer, uncovered, until a small white spiral becomes visible in each grain, about 9 minutes. Drain the quinoa and transfer it to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the pistachios, cranberries, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Place the spinach in a large mixing bowl and toss with the hot squash until slightly wilted. Add the quinoa mixture and toss again. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
