    <h1>Black Bean Burger</h1>
<h4><p>It’s a delicious, kid-friendly, and healthy alternative to greasy beef burgers.</p></h4>
<h4><p>Ingredients</p></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>1 15-ounce can black beans</li>
        <li>½ onion, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup corn</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>¼ cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salsa</li>
    </ul>
<h4><p>Toppings</p></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Romain lettuce</li>
    </ul>

<h4><p>Steps</p></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To cook the brown rice, bring ½ cup of rice and 1 cup of water to a boil in a pot. Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer. Once water is absorbed, taste rice to see if fully cooked. If not, add a little more water and let simmer until it’s ready. Boil beans until soft or drain canned beans. Pour beans in a medium size bowl and mash them with your hands, potato masher, or fork.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350º F. Lay a piece of parchment paper on sheet pan.
        </li>
        <li>Sweat the onion in a sauté pan. Sweat means the moisture comes from the veggies so no oil is needed. Just remember to keep a lid on the pan. If the onions do start to stick, add a little bit of water. When onions become translucent add corn and spices. Cook for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cornmeal, salsa, veggies, and rice to bean bowl. Mix everything together so there is an even consistency. Feel free to do this with your hands. Then form mixture into patties. A good thickness is about ½ inch and I like to make mine around 3 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place patties onto parchment paper and bake for 15 minutes at 350ºF. Flip the patties and bake for another 15 minutes. Serve between two leaves of romaine lettuce with tomato, onion, ketchup, and mustard. Or try putting the burger on a bed of fresh spinach instead of the bun</li>
    </ol>
<h4><p>Substitutions</p></h4>
        <p>You can use chickpeas in place of black beans.

            You can use white rice instead of brown rice.
            
            Use any leafy greens you like, such as baby spinach lettuce, kale, or bok choy.</p>
